Lab Overview:

Lab Details

•	This lab walks you through the steps to understand and configure to set your environment for ansible.
•	You will practice using the terminal.

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies complex IT tasks, making them more efficient and scalable. 
It falls under the category of configuration management and orchestration tools, designed to automate various aspects of IT infrastructure management, 
deployment, and application provisioning.


Step-by-Step Instructions:

 	Step1: Install  the Package

	On master node
•	yum  install epel-release   --- as root user
•	yum install ansible -y

 	Step2: Entry of all the Managed Host in host file

	On master node,worker1 and worker2 node 

•	vim /etc/hosts
            172.25.100.143   master
            172.25.100.144   worker1
            172.25.100.145   worker2

Cross-Verify 
            Run these commands from master node 
•	ping -c3 worker1 
•	ping -c3 worker2 

 	Step3: Add  the user of your choice in the system with same name in master worker1 and worker2

	On master node,worker1 and worker2 node 
•	useradd  newuser                         
•	passwd newuser

•	vim /etc/sudoers

         Copying the suoders file in managed hosts
•	scp -r /etc/sudoers worker1: /etc/sudoers
•	scp -r /etc/sudoers worker2: /etc/suoders

Cross-verify the entries is made in sudoers file 

Password less authentication via ssh

	In master node:
•	ssh-keygen
•	ssh-copy-id newuser@worker1
•	ssh-copy-id newuser@worker2


Cross- verify the entries
•	ls- la 
•	cd .ssh
•	cat  .ssh/authorization_ key
